BACONHAND!
==========

A plugin for gently reminding you in development mode that your views are
accessing the database. By doing so, it steers you towards collecting all data
required to render the view in the controller, which usually highlights
previously hidden options for combining data access into as few and as fast
queries as possible.

TODO
----

  * Make this work for Rails 2.0.
  * Make baconhanding disableable for some controllers and actions.
